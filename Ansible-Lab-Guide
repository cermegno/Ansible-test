# Use Ansible to verify connectivity

# Let's instruct Ansible to ask for passwords instead of certificates
ansible all -m ping -k
# We are using the same user for all hosts, so it asks for the password only once

# Now you can run it

# Can you find out what version of Python is running on all boxes? TIP: python -V
# Can you find out whether "pip" is installed? TIP: python-pip

##############
# EXERCISE 1 #
##############
# Write your own playbook file to do this on the webserver host:
# - install pip with the yum module (python-pip)
# - install flask with the pip module
# - copy the web.py from the https://github.com/cermegno/Ansible-test repo, but name it "app.py". Dont use the local copy you cloned
# - run the script so that the web server starts
# TIP1: look for the 'pip' module
# TIP2: look for the 'get_url' module
# TIP3: format to retrieve github files is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{user}/{repo}/{branch}/{filename}
# TIP4: This is the task to run the app.py

  - name: Start the script
    shell: cd /root ;  nohup python app.py </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1 &

# You can test it from the mgmt server with cURL:
curl http://192.168.56.20:5000

# In order to test it from a graphical browser you need to forward the port
# In VirtualBox go to Host1 > Settings > Network > Adapter 1 > Port Forwarding and set a rule:
# Web, TCP, 127.0.0.1, 5000, 192.168.56.20, 5000
# Now you should see it from your laptop browser
http://127.0.0.1:5000

# Let's use the "service" module to check if the following services are started: crond, redis
ansible all -m service -a  "name=crond state=started"
ansible all -m service -a  "name=redis state=started"

##############
# EXERCISE 2 #
##############
# Write your own playbook file to do the following:
# On the 'database' server only
# - install Redis on the database host
# - ensure the /etc/redis.conf file has the "bind 127.0.0.1" line commented out
# - ensure the redis service is started

# SSH to the database server and check that Redis is working
ssh root@192.168.56.21
